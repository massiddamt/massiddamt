### Hi there, I'm Matteo ðŸ‘‹

I'm a bioinformatician based in Sardinia, (Italy). 

I am currently working at the Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari.

Previously I worked at the Center for Advanced Studies, Research and Development in Sardinia, where we have created an open-source collection of Snakemake-based workflows, [solida-core](https://github.com/solida-core).
