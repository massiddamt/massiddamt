### Hi there, I'm Matteo ðŸ‘‹

I am a bioinformatician post-doc at IRGB-CNR in Cagliari, Italy.

I started my academic career as a molecular biologist, working with DNA analysis techniques such as extraction, PCR, RFLP, Sanger sequencing, and NGS.

Over the past eight years, I have specialized in bioinformatics, mainly focusing on NGS data analysis and the *development of scalable and reproducible bioinformatics workflows* using *Snakemake*.

During my time at CRS4, I contributed to the creation of a set of publicly available bioinformatics pipelines, now part of the [solida-core](https://github.com/solida-core) collection.

From 2022 to September 2024, I worked at the University of Sassari (Department of Medical, Surgical, and Experimental Sciences). During this period, I collaborated with colleagues at IRGB-CNR in Cagliari, contributing to the development of GeneBANGS, a collection of reproducible bioinformatics pipelines, available on GitHub: [GeneBANGS](https://github.com/GeneBANGS).

Since September 2024, I have been working as a post-doc bioinformatician at IRGB-CNR in Cagliari, where I am involved in multiple research projects. My main focus includes:
	â€¢	Transcriptome, mirnome analysis of CRC patients for the identification of prognostic markers.
	â€¢	Exome and genome analysis in projects related to the study of complex diseases.

If youâ€™re interested in a collaboration, feel free to contact me via email at [matteomassidda@cnr.it](mailto:matteomassidda@cnr.it).

Thanks,
Matteo
