### Hi there, I'm Matteo ðŸ‘‹

I'm a bioinformatician based in Cagliari, (Italy). 

I am currently working at CRS4 ([Center for Advanced Studies, Research and Development in Sardinia](https://www.crs4.it)) in the Next Generation Sequencing Core Program.
Here I am responsible for NGS Data Analysis and bioinformatic pipelines development and maintenance.

During these years, we have created an open-source collection of Snakemake-based workflows, [solida-core](https://github.com/solida-core).
