### Hi there, I'm Matteo ðŸ‘‹

I am a bioinformatician and work in Sardinia (Italy). 

I started my academic career as a molecular biologist, dealing with the study of DNA using common techniques such as extraction, PCR, RFLP, Sanger sequencing and NGS.

I have subsequently undertook training that has led me into *bioinformatics* for the past 8 years. Mainly I have been involved in the analysis of NGS data and, most importantly, the *development of scalable and reproducible bioinformatics analysis workflows*. To do this I used the workflow manager *Snakemake*.

As a result, previous work experience at CRS4 led to the creation of a set of publicly available bioinformatics pipelines encapsulated in the [solida-core](https://github.com/solida-core) collection.

Since 2022 I have been working at the University of Sassari (Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences) and in collaboration with some colleagues at the IRGB-CNR in Cagliari we have created a new collection of reproducible pipelines available on github at the following link: [GeneBANGS](https://github.com/GeneBANGS).

The main project I am actually focused on is the analysis of the transcriptome of CRC patients for the identification of prognostic markers.

If you are interested in a collaboration please do not hesitate to contact me with an email to [mmassidda@uniss.it](mailto:mmassidda@uniss.it).

Thanks,

Matteo
